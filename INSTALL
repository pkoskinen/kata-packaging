Installation for kata administrators

Installation should be carried out on a clean RHEL 6 / CentOS 6 machine


I. Packages delivered:

1. mcfg.rpm  (called the master configuration tool)
2. solr.rpm
3. kata-prod.rpm
4. dummy-deps.rpm

(rpm files will have version numbers in their names, these have been left
out in this document for the sake of simplicity. Of course you need to
specify complete file names including version numbers in all commands
given below.)


II. General remarks

In order to be able to debug possible installation problems it is useful
to run critical installation steps inside script. (See script(1))

With a longer lifetime of the installation and possible later upgrades
in mind it might also be useful to use etckeeper (see
http://joeyh.name/code/etckeeper/). However, this is the
administrator's choice, the delivered software does not depend in any
way on etckeeper. Etckeeper has been used successfully during our
testing at the customer site. Describing etckeeper usage is beyond the
scope of this document. However, it can be mentioned that after
etckeeper installation no manual steps are required related to any
step described in this document.

By default CentOS / Redhat comes with a closed firewall (all incoming
ports closed, all outgoing ports open). 

Originally our package opened the firewall for KATA (only standard
ports 80 and 443 are required). This functionality has been removed,
because the customer preferred to use their own scripts.  Using RHEL 6
/ CentOS 6 default tools the firewall can be persistently configured
with the following 2 commands

  - "sudo lokkit --update -p 80:tcp"
  - "sudo lokkit --update -p 443:tcp"

Opening further ports is not needed for KATA and happens on the
administrator's own risk.


II. Installation steps

1. Enable EPEL & Shibboleth repos
   1.a. "sudo yum install http://www.nic.funet.fi/pub/mirrors/fedora.redhat.com/pub/epel/6/i386/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm"
   1.b "cd /etc/yum.repos.d"
   1.c "sudo curl -O http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security://shibboleth/CentOS_CentOS-6/security:shibboleth.repo"


2. Install dummy-deps

   (This package helps to avoid having packages installed, which are not
   required on a production server)

   "sudo yum install dummy-deps.rpm"


3. Install Apache solr

   3.a. "sudo yum install solr.rpm"


4. Install master configuration tool

   4.a. "sudo yum install mcfg.rpm"
   4.b. copy the provided master configuration sample file
        "sudo cp -i /usr/share/mcfg/examples/kata-master.ini /root/"
   4.c. Edit it "sudo -e /root/kata-master.ini"
        Cf. Appendix A Configuration for details


5. Install kata

   5.a. Make sure the certificate & key input files referred to by
        /root/kata-master.ini are in place (typically /root/sp-{root,key}.pem)
   5.b. The next step will produce a lot of output. It is recommended to start
        a script session now
   5.c. "sudo yum install kata.rpm"
   5.d. Terminate the script session if you started one

6. Use kata

   System is operational. All configuration has happened in step 4.c.


A. Configuration

A.1. SSL keys and certificates

   Apache and Shibboleth need an SSL key and certificate pair. It's possible
   the use the same pair for both programs or have a different pair for each
   program.

   The configuration is slightly different for the two programs. The
   key/certificate pair for Shibboleth will be installed by mcfg. The
   administrator provides the input filenames in the following two
   parameters in /root/kata-master.ini (Installation means the files are
   copied to /etc/shibboleth as spcert.pem and spkey.pem. After installation
   the input files could be deleted.)

[shibboleth-sp-cert]
location: /root/sp-cert.pem

[shibboleth-sp-key]
location: /root/sp-key.pem

   The filenames should be given as absolute paths, the names do not matter.

   For Apache the key/certificate pair is not installed by mcfg, but the file
   names of a previously installed pair are given in the following 2
   parameters

[DEFAULT]
apache_ssl_cert: /etc/shibboleth/spcert.pem
apache_ssl_key: /etc/shibboleth/spkey.pem
apache_ssl_bundle: /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
   The default values shown here refer to the Shibboleth key/certificate pair.
   If they remain unchanged Apache will use the same certificates that are
   being installed for Shibboleth as previously described. The bundle is 
   separate from Shibboleth, but it is installed via mod_ssl.
